## Catastrophe C++ Client
##### By: Michael Ranciglio and Aaron Gunther

This is Aaron and I's C++ Catastrophe AI client for MegaminerAI 20. This has
been open-sourced for the benefit of all future competitors or anybody else
really.

This is a very cleaned up and more functionalized version of our original competition code which can be found in the master branch.
This was done in order to use this AI for presentations for new megaminer competitors or really just anyone wanting an example of what to expect.
