# Arrays Start at Zero
## Catastrophe C++ Client
##### By: Michael Ranciglio and Aaron Gunther

This is Aaron and I's C++ Catastrophe AI client for MegaminerAI 20. This has
been open-sourced for the benefit of all future competitors or anybody else
really.

This is a very cleaned up and more functionalized version of our original competition code which can be found here:
https://github.com/Snepsts/megaminerai-catastrophe
This was done in order to use this AI for presentations for new megaminer competitors or really just anyone wanting an example of what to expect.

### How to Run

`make`

`./testRun MyOwnGameSession`

Note: testRun probably won't work without modifications and a different host.
