# Arrays Start at Zero
## Catastrophe C++ Client
##### By: Michael Ranciglio and Aaron Gunther

This is Aaron and I's C++ Catastrophe AI client for MegaminerAI 20. This has
been open-sourced for the benefit of all future competitors or anybody else
really.

We believe we did excellently with this code, and if our death_squad check
didn't trip too early every game, we're confident we would have done much
better. But you know, shoulda coulda woulda. We're still proud of what we
accomplished. Enjoy!

### How to Run

`make`
`./testRun MyOwnGameSession`

Note: testRun probably won't work without modifications and a different host.
